### Note:

```diff
- You need to create SP on main server in sql server and push them down to fragmented sites.
- I have saved the SP in the file stored_procedure.txt
- The project part only accounts for 40% of the total score, the remaining 60% is theory, so you need to learn the theory well.
- I have saved the theory part at cauhoi.txt, all the questions that Mr. Luu Nguyen Ky Thu are there.
- Try your best.
